# Turbid-Media-Propagation-Simulation
Simulation of 2 photon signal in turbid sample

Simulate beam degradation during propagation through sample with bimodal RI
Simulate ability to image grating structure with this beam

Add beam correction and see how effective this could be, and which plane we should place the SLM.
